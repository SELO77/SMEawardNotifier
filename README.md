<h2>1. What is SMEawardNotifier?</h2>
This is a simple telegram bot for crawling updates from http://www.smtech.go.kr/front/main/main.do *

*smtech is a web portal for SME R&D award open calls subsidized by MSS(operated by TIPA)

<h2>2. How do I automate program?</h2>
(Note: Python must be installed)
Given that you are using Windows, go to Task Scheduler > Create Basic Task. 

There you can choose from several options, and you are good to be notified of the recent updatets from smtech!

This process incurs you some hassle, but works nicely if you are in intranet envrionment.(i.e. governments)
